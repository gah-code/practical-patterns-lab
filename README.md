# Practical Patterns Lab DRAFT

This repository is a hands-on lab for React developers looking to practice and reinforce React concepts I've found helpful, advanced state management strategies, performance optimizations, and more. Each central concept lives in its folder, accompanied by Markdown documentation explaining the relevant patterns and best practices.

## Jest + Babel Configuration (Minimal Example) DRAFT

Jest testing configuration to ensure seamless testing of your React components with Babel and Testing Library.

## Overview

**Practical Patterns Lab** The project came to life after an 80-hour coding course aimed at front-end development. It features a concept-driven structure, with each folder focusing on specific topics like performance optimization and advanced state management. Each folder contains a `.md` file with essential patterns, best practices, and practical examples to inspire and guide your learning.

Key highlights:

- **Concept-Centric Folders**: Code samples, components, and usage notes grouped by subject rather than by specific hooks or UI elements.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: ESLint integration ensures you follow best practices (React Hooks, accessibility, code style).

---

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Concept-Based Learning**: Organize patterns (like advanced state management, SPA architecture, performance tuning) in dedicated folders.
2. **Hands-On Examples**: Each concept folder includes code examples and a `.md` file describing core ideas and usage scenarios.
3. **Best Practices**: Demonstrate recommended approaches for hooking up contexts, reducers, or advanced routing while avoiding typical React pitfalls.
4. **Performance & Accessibility**: Highlight performance patterns (e.g., memoization, Suspense) and maintain high accessibility standards.
5. **Robust Testing**: Showcase a working Jest + Babel + Testing Library setup for verifying component correctness in a DOM-like environment.

---

## Folder Structure

Below is a **Draft** outline. Each concept folder contains:

- **Code Files** (components, hooks, utility functions) illustrating the subject matter.
- A **Markdown Document** describing the approach, usage, and additional tips.

### What’s in Each Folder?

- **advanced-state-management**: Demos of `useReducer`, global state with Context API, and/or Redux examples (each approach described in `advanced-state-management.md`).
- **performance-optimizations**: Patterns for optimizing renders (`React.memo`), minimizing re-renders (`useMemo`, `useCallback`), and code splitting with Suspense.
- **spa-architecture**: Routing strategies (React Router, data loaders, or code splitting routes) and how to structure single-page applications.
- **core-components**: Reusable, common UI components used across different concepts or demos.
- **test**: Contains test files and any necessary setup (e.g., for Jest or Vitest).

This structure allows you to add new folders in the future without cluttering existing ones, making it easier to locate and iterate on patterns independently.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/practical-patterns-lab.git
   cd practical-patterns-lab
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Dev Server**  

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open the provided local URL (often <http://localhost:5173/>) in your browser.

4. **Lint Your Code**  

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   This ensures code adheres to React Hooks rules, accessibility guidelines, etc.

## Running Tests

This lab includes a **basic test script** using common packages like **Jest** (or **Vitest**). For example, if you’ve installed Jest:

1. **Check the `test` script** in `package.json`:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",
       "build": "vite build",
       "preview": "vite preview",
       "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.jsx src",
       "test": "jest"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. **Write your own** tests in `src/test/`:

   ```js
   // example.test.js
   import React from 'react';
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import Button from '../core-components/Button';

   test('renders a button with text', () => {
     render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
     expect(screen.getByText(/click me/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

> **Note**: If you prefer **Vitest** (which integrates well with Vite), replace Jest with Vitest configurations. The approach is similar—just update your scripts and test setup accordingly.

## Future Plans

- **Additional Concepts**: Add more folders for topics like animation, authentication, error handling, etc.
- **Interactive Challenges**: Expand the lab to include short coding exercises or tasks that must pass certain tests before they can be “completed.”
- **Deployment Scenarios**: Provide examples for hosting on Netlify, Vercel, or other platforms.
